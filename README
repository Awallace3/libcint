INTERFACE KLUDGES

The second (comment) line in the xyz file contains the net charge
of the system.

The first line of the basis set file (gbs file) contains "spherical"
or "cartesian" to indicate the basis set type.

The SCF initial guess for the density matrix is constructed from
the superposition of atomic densities (SAD).  The densities for 
a few atoms are read automatically, but assumes you are using
cc-pvdz.

The SAD initial guess also assumes using a spherical basis.
